# Zenith Robotics Workshop
As a part of Zenith 2022, Tech Club conducted a series of workshops about using ROS and Gazebo to simulate path planning algorithms on a turtlebot.

## Installation & Setup
You can setup the required application and files, in two methods

1. **Using Docker**
    
    Using docker images allow you to run the applications required on pretty much any of your favourite OS, be it windows, linux or mac. It also ensures that you don't run into any dependency issues. Follow the instructions below to setup a docker image which we have built with ROS and the other dependencies preinstalled.
      
    1. [Using Docker to setup ROS on Windows](Documentation/setup/docker/docker_windows)
    2. [Using Docker to setup ROS on Linux](Documentation/setup/docker/docker_linux)

2. **Locally Installing**

    In case you have been using Ubuntu on a dual boot or on a virtual machine and would like to setup ROS locally on your system follow these [instructions](Documentation/setup/local_installation)
